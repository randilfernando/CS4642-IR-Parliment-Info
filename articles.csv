Minister Dinesh Gunawardane is not only the leader of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna which I represent, but also an elder brother of mine. , ,The Chief Government Whip faced many a problem when the chair conducted the affairs of the House in the recent past and you will acknowledge that there is likelihood of a similar situation come into being in the future as well. , ,It is a norm accepted by all of us that under these circumstances when administering justice it should be fair and lawful and that it should be exhibited from our conduct itself. , ,I wish to state that it was due to that moralistic bond with the constitution that I resigned from the post of Deputy Speaker, conferred on me by the constitution on the basis of importance in safeguarding the dignity of the chair and the parliamentary tradition. , ,I express my gratitude to you, Hon. Prime Minister and H.E the President for giving me the opportunity of carrying out my duties without any undue influence. I also appreciate with respect, the understanding of H.E the President of the explanation made by me regarding my resignation. I believe that this will pave the way for the Chief Whip of the government to carry out the duties of the post without difficulty. Last but not least I extend my thanks to you, the Prime Minister, the leader of the opposition, all ministers and Members of Parliament of both the government and opposition and the entire staff of Parliament from the Secretary General to garden labourer for placing their trust on me and extending their co-operation. My thanks are also due to all journalists. , ,I wish whole heartedly that the newly appointed Deputy Speaker, Hon.

"""A red letter day in the history of Parliament of Sri Lanka"" mentioned the Deputy Speaker when he addressed the gathering at the Parliament website launch. , ,Find the speech made by the Deputy Speaker in full below. , ,Hon. Prime Minister ,Hon. Speaker ,Hon. Members of Parliament ,Secretary to His Excellency the President ,Distinguished invitees ,Ladies and Gentlemen: , ,I consider today as a red letter day in the history of Parliament of Sri Lanka. People of this country enjoyed universal franchise since 1931, which is seventeen years before independence and just a few years after United Kingdom enabled its women the right to vote. From first past the post to proportional representation people casted their vote, performing their civic duty and many would burn the midnight oil in a festive mood to await the result, not to mention unfortunate excesses that took place in certain elections. The question before many is after the hustings what next? , ,Until today the communication between Parliament, its members and the rest took place through the print media. Letters constitute the communication between people and members. The Hansard is the official record of proceedings. The newspapers give publicity to the proceedings as well as photographs. In theory the Parliament should be open to the public as the representatives perform a duty on behalf of the people. Unfortunately, considerations of security, necessitated by acts of aggression, now surround every Parliament of the world. In an era where people demand transparency, the physical access to Parliament and other government institutions need be restricted, which appears to be a paradox. , ,However we can overcome these challenges through the evolution of the information communication technology and the revolution it is creating in our daily lives. Electronic communication was born with the invention of the telegraph and the telephone. Easy storage of information and its equal ease of retrieval became possible with aid of computers, which originally served the computational needs of the scientific community. Communication between computers made the easy retrieval of information stored in one computer with the aid of another. The birth of the internet facilitated methods of communication between computers and a universal network of access. The internet has come to our aid enabling us to be accessed through computers open to all. The main advantage is that it no longer requires face to face contact thus avoiding the risks of acts of aggression. , ,The commonest feature in the process of access is to retrieve what is known as web pages. By pages it is to be understood as chunks of pictures and texts displayed per screen. This is the equivalent of a notice board or a billboard. Now the pictures and the texts could be dynamic with animations. In addition this could be enriched with sound as well. , ,But a web page in the modern world is far beyond a mere notice board of display. It can be interactive. It could be configured to have a set of pages for every Member of Parliament where every citizen, with or without subject to identification can communicate with a member, both ways. The communication could be text based in the form of notes or letters. In a further advancement it could be a chat in the form text. The more advanced could be live audio and the ultimate being audio and video as well. A further development in this direction would be web based conference linking the citizens in a public library conference hall and the elected representative in Parliamentary premises. , ,Richness of an entity, be it individual, family, group, village, town or a country depends on what fraction of time it spends in planning for its future while dealing with the present. In this context any serious legislator would be on the look out for good ideas. Unfortunately the average culture of many so called responsible, is to treat letters as a nuisance. On the other hand an invitation to express views on policy of given subjects would evoke response from a limited group of intellectuals. The web based consultation would be an ideal source for a legislator to get ideas on a given subject across the board. , ,Any Parliament is a wealth of knowledge. Its library hitherto restricted by physical access can be made on-line thus enabling any audience, restricted or otherwise to refer to its material. I am fully aware that it would be a herculean task to feed in to web, the hansard, present and the past, leave alone all the printed material in our library. However, I am relieved to note that there are, IT enabled service providers available locally who can undertake to face the rigours of this exercise. A photographic gallery of distinguished legislators itself would definitely be an attraction and a challenge. The most daunting would be to have multimedia documentaries made available on-line based on the material available. ,Clearly www.parliament.lk follows the address of the mother of all Commonwealth Parliaments www.parliament.uk. However we would have to maintain our own identity as we are a unicameral legislature as opposed to the UK legislature being bi-cameral and with judicial functions. Today, in reality it is a small step we take in the direction we have to move many a mile. , ,I trust that the developers of our system who are very capable have made it resilient to so called cyber-attacks. In any case it is physically less damaging than an act of aggression in the form of a physical attack. However we cannot risk the loss of data or the disturbance it would cause once sizeable number of population in the globe starts making use of it .I therefore take this opportunity to remind the cutodians of this system both present and in the future to guard this system and ensure its security from attacks which are modernised and innovated everyday. , ,We have to thank the United Nations Development Program for the generous assistance both in cash and kind towards the humble beginnings of our legislature being a part of the World Wide Web. I have to thank them once again for its commitment to build the institutional capacity of many an organ of the public in the developing countries in general and the parliament of Sri Lanka in particular. It is through this institutional building, an enhancement of public good that enables the serving of the public better and permits the foster care and the growth of the private good, thus enriching our people to be above the poverty line. , ,We in Sri Lanka recognize the role of the agency on information Communication Technology (ICTA) which was also a partner in this exercise. Its role is not limited to the Parliament of Sri Lanka but to the entire nation. It funded this project both in cash and kind. I am confident that professionals in Sri Lanka in general and the professionals in the Agency in particular would enrich the internet world of Sri Lanka thus contributing to an effective regime of governance in Sri Lanka. I would be failing in my duty if no mention is made of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapakse, the President of this country, who as the Minister in Charge of the subject of the Agency gave stewardship to ICTA and was very keen in the implementation of this venture. , ,I take this opportunity to thank all those who came today in response to our invitation to be with us and share our joy on this memorable occasion. , ,Thank you.",17-02-2006,"""A red letter day in the history of Parliament of Sri Lanka"" said the Deputy Speaker"
